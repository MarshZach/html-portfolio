<h1>The Best Movies According to Zach</h1>
<h2>Top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Samurai Trilogy</h3>
<p>Love the complete story of a ronan's growth into a samurai. Lots of great morals throughout</p>
<h3>Dr Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb</h3>
<p>Really great satirical take on the horrors of the atomic bomb during the Cold War.</p>
<h3>Charade</h3>
<p>Witty 'who dun it film' with a nice twist</p>
